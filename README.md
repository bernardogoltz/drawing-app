# Drawing App 

## Motivation to build this project 
Me and my friends talk to each other nearly every night on "Discord" about how the week is going and how much we want the college semester to be over. And some days, when we want to share an idea, the necessity of an app to draw something simple and minimalist comes up. Motivated by this demand, and the fact that I'm learning some front-end skills, I decided  to create this <strong>Drawing App</strong> and started my studies.

## Technologies and Sources. 
I created this simple app using canvas API ```<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>```
, which is used in animations, drawings, sketches, games, data visualization and a few other things.  To use this API, we need to get the canvas element using ```document.getElementById()``` and give the appropriate context - where the drawing will be rendered. After learning how the canvas api works by watching some videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GqUM4mEYKA&t=225s&ab_channel=DevEd">Learn HTML5 Canvas By Creating A Drawing App | HTML Canvas Tutorial</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=8499s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org">FreeCodeCampJ JavaScript Projects </a>, I tried to design my own app, like I always wished to find on the internet. 

Special thanks to my girlfriend Fernanda who helped me with this little text.
