# Drawining App 

## Motivation to build this project 
Me and my friends used to talk nearly every nights on "discord", to talk between Us how the week is going and how boring is going the college semester. And in some days, when we are share our screen to each other, the necessity of draw something simple and  minimalist app comes up, just black on white. Motivated by this necessity, and considering that I'm learning some front-end skills, there is: I dedice  to create this <strong>Drawining App</strong> and started my studies.

## Technologies and Sources. 
I created this simple app using canvas API ```<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>```
, which is using in animations, draws, sketchs, games, data visualization and a couple of other things.  To use this API, we need to get the canvas element using ```document.getElementById()``` and give the apropriate context - the thing on which the drawing will be rendered. After learned how the canvas api work watching some videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GqUM4mEYKA&t=225s&ab_channel=DevEd">Learn HTML5 Canvas By Creating A Drawing App | HTML Canvas Tutorial</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=8499s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org">FreeCodeCampJ JavaScript Projects </a>, I tried to design my own app, like always i have been wishing to find on internet.
